Leeds City Council archives daily meter readings from all solar PV installations on council-owned homes across Leeds.

The data is available here: https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/solar-pv--photovolataics--data

The Jupyter notebook named 'leeds_solar_v3' does the following...

(1) Cleans the raw data and calculates capacity factors 

(2) Plots the annual profile of PV capacity factor averaged across all sites and monthly means for individual sites

(3) Demonstrates two simple estimates of typical solar PV yields in Leeds using satellite and model-derived irradiance data
